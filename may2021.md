## Project
Established Business Metrics Dashboard towards 2021 Strategy objectives within [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/cloud-bi).

## Project Goal
As a part of Nant's 2021 business strategy, we collectively wanted to drive an environmental campaign. 

Our pledge was to reduce our carbon footprint, water and paper usage as an organisation.

One of the best ways to ensure we are doing this is by monitoring what we our current metrics were.

After knowing what we consume, we are able to set targets and begin lowering our resource usage.

## Project Outcomes
Tableau has proven an invaluable tool for storing, displaying and monitoring our fuel usage, expenditure, and CO2 output.

Combining our water, gas and paper bills, we are able to estimate the usage for these resources.

It has been a real eye opener to individuals wihtin the business as to just how much the organisation uses.

It has helped us to identify which of our fleet vehicles are more efficient than others, and which vehicles to consider buying in the future to reduce our emissions.
